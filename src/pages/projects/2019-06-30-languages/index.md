*Jun. 2019 - ongoing*

Various projects related to endangered languages revitalization, to be updated. I am passionate about languages in general, and endangered languages strike a chord with me.

#### Walela Project

I am interested in finding ways to harness artificial intelligence (AI) to help document and revitalize endangered languages. I am currently thinking of pursuing this idea by starting a tech nonprofit. If you have ideas, want to help or are just curious to chat, get in touch with me! I would love to hear your thoughts.

#### __Yugtun LKSD__ app

With Christopher W. Liu, developed an educational app to facilitate Yup'ik language learning in 18 Yup'ik/English immersion schools of the Lower Kuskokwim School District (LKSD) in Southwest Alaska. The app is available for free on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yugtungrammar&hl=en_US) and [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/gy/app/yugtun-lksd/id1495576658).
