Currently a third-year PhD candidate at Stanford in Physics (minor in Linguistics).

I work in the [Neutrino Group](https://sites.slac.stanford.edu/neutrino/) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory under the supervision of [Kazuhiro Terao](http://www.codingkazu.com) and [Hirohisa Tanaka](https://profiles.stanford.edu/hirohisa-tanaka). My main focus is on deep learning applications to data reconstruction and analysis of neutrino detectors based on liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPC), such as [ICARUS](https://icarus.fnal.gov/).

Formerly graduated from [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (France) where I studied mathematics, physics and computer science.
