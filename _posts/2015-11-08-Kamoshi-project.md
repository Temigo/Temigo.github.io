I'm very pleased to announce the open-source **Kamoshi** project.

It aims at creating origami diagrams more easily than ever. 
Currently, existing software are mere simplifications of Inkscape and the like. 
It's tricky to output origami diagrams as quickly as you invent models !

The Kamoshi project is composed of several softwares :

* **Kamoshi Creator** : all you have to do is click on the right point to explain the computer your folding. Kamoshi is doing everything else and outputs a diagram.
* **Kamoshi Reader** : 3D reconstitution of the folding given an origami diagram
* **Kamoshi Editor** :  since computers aren't as clever as humans, you may need to edit the outputed diagram and fix it.
* **Kamoshi Vision** : extraction of an origami diagram from a video showing the folding process (computer vision needed !)

In the future, we may have only to exchange a Kamoshi diagram file in order to have all these features : reading the diagram, editing it, viewing it in 3D, sharing it. 

May this project promote open origami !
