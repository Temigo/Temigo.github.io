I'm very pleased to announce the open-source Kamoshi project.

It aims at creating origami diagrams more easily than ever. 
Currently, existing software are mere simplifications of Inkscape and the like. 
It's tricky to output origami diagrams as quickly as you invent models !

The Kamoshi project is composed of several softwares :

* Kamoshi Creator : all you have to do is click on the right point to explain the computer your folding. Kamoshi is doing everything left.
* Kamoshi Reader : 3D reconstituation of origami diagrams
* Kamoshi Editor :  computers aren't as clever as humans, you may need to edit the outputed diagram and fix it.
* Kamoshi Vision : extraction of an origami diagram from a video
