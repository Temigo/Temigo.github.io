'Man's Fate' (1933, 'La condition humaine' in French) is a novel by André Malraux that is no less well-known (at least in France). Both of these works deeply impressed me. After some maturation time, I was astonished to see some parallels emerge and that is what I would like to share with you here."}}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/posts/aymara/",categorySlug:"/categories/languages/"},frontmatter:{title:"Aymara",date:"2018-02-03",category:"Languages",description:"The Altiplano is a fascinating place at the heart of  the Andes, the most extensive area of high plateau after Tibet.

One of the most famous is recursion. In any language one can always form an arbitrarily long sentence. Always? Not quite. According to Daniel Everett, up to now the only non-native of the Pirahã Amazonian tribe who has ever understood their language, the Pirahã language does have a sentence of maximal length. Of course this statement stirred a durable controverse among linguists and prompted Noam Chomsky to criticize him as a 'charlatan'. Yet his story is interesting and, in my opinion, worth listening to."}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
