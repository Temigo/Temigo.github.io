Clouds bring uneven illumination, blurring and occlusion of the target. Satellite images are traditionally multispectral, i.e. include only a few wavelengths. Hyperspectral images include numerous wavelengths, including near-infrared, and are becoming more widely available. Finally, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are among the most successful unsupervised techniques for generating realistic images by training 2 networks in competition (generator vs discriminator).</p>\n<p>I proposed to apply GANs to hyperspectral satellite images in order to generate the missing patches from below the clouds. I devised and implemented the whole data pre-processing pipeline which includes classifying satellite images patches as cloudy/clear and synthesizing cloud masks.</p>\n<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/kumo-san">DevPost</a> -\n<a href="http://stanford.edu/~ldomine/ICME_LDomine.pdf">Invited poster at ICME Xpo 2018</a></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to Laura, who won 2! awards at <a href="https://twitter.com/Stanford?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Stanford</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BigEarthHacks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BigEarthHacks</a>: best solo team &amp; best <a href="https://twitter.com/Satellogic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Satellogic</a> use üëè‚ô•Ô∏èüë©‚Äçüíª.

Liu</em></p>\n<p>Won 1st prize (based on the reports) for the course project of <a href="http://cs224n.stanford.edu">CS224n - Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</a>.</p>\n<p>Machine translation tools do not yet exist for the Yup‚Äôik Eskimo language. It is a low-resource language spoken by around 8,000 people who primarily live in Southwest Alaska. With the availability of Yup‚Äôik Eskimo / English parallel text (~100k sentences), we developed a pipeline for reliable translation of this language pair.</p>\n<p>We wrote a morphological rule-based parser for the Yup‚Äôik Eskimo language and compared it with other unsupervised tokenization methods. We trained a bidirectional LSTM model with attention and reached a BLEU score of 13 using Byte-Pair Encoding, an unsupervised tokenization method.</p>\n<p>We are now working on the development of <strong>Yuarcuun</strong>, a translation and dictionary tool for Yup‚Äôik Eskimo which will be available online.</p>\n<p><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/6907893.pdf">Final Report</a> -\n<a href="https://github.com/cwtliu/yupik-mt">Machine Translation Code</a> -\n<a href="https://github.com/Temigo/yuarcuun-api">Yuarcuun API Code</a> -\n<a href="https://github.com/Temigo/yuarcuun-web">Yuarcuun Web interface</a></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Byte pair encodings as good as morphological analysis based on Morfessor for low resource machine translation on Yup&#39;ik Eskimo to English. <a href="https://t.co/hdauwgEQUG">pic.twitter.com/hdauwgEQUG</a></p>&mdash; Richard (@RichardSocher) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/976647886099263488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">22 March 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n<h2>Whisper App: Rumour source detection</h2>\n<p><em>Sep. 2015 - June 2016.

With Micka√´l Latocca, R√©mi Said, Louis Lallemand, Quentin Bertrand, Henri Bourdeau, Carolina Garcia.</em></p>\n<p>Finding the source of an epidemics can be crucial in many ways: cascading failures and the resulting black-outs are critical for energy distribution networks, virus epidemics that wreak havoc but could be neutralized faster if only we understood where it came from, fake informations spreading on social networks that can have serious consequences for financial markets‚Ä¶ Around 2010 some researchers started looking into algorithms to automatically detect the origin of an epidemics given the contaminated graph (or part of it).</p>\n<p>I led a team of 6 students at Ecole polytechnique to investigate these rumour source detection algorithms. We designed several algorithms of our own and built a web interface (Whisper App) to allow the interactive execution of algorithms from the literature in addition to ours.</p>\n<p><a href="http://temigo.pythonanywhere.com/#/">Try Whisper App online!</a> -\n<a href="https://github.com/Temigo/whisper-app">Back-end code</a> -\n<a href="https://github.com/Temigo/whisper-app-client">Front-end code</a> -\n<a href="https://github.com/Temigo/whisper">Algorithms implementations</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Projects",date:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/projects"}}}});
